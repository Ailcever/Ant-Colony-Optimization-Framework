# Ant-Colony-Optimization-Framework

## About ACO 
Ant Colony Optimization is a member of the ant colony algorithms family, in swarm intelligence methods, 
and it constitutes some metaheuristic optimizations. The original algorithm was aiming to search 
for an optimal path in a graph, based on the behavior of ants seeking a path between their colony 
and a source of food.

## Used in Cloud Task Scheduling
This framework aims at optimizing the tasks submitted to a number of Virtual Machines.
The simulator to be used is Cloudsim by Melbourne Clouds Lab.
